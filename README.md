This project is focused on using machine learning to predict life expectancy based on a wide range of factors. To achieve this, I used a multiple linear regression method and combined this with interactive graphs and displays to demonstrate how variables like education and average GDP link to life expectancy across continents. I ensured that all data I used fit key assumptions for the regression analysis and worked to correct for factors like heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, etc. that can potentially disrupt my end results.
